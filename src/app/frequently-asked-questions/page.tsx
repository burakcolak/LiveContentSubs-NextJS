              answer="You can participate using the Twitch viewer bot. There are many criteria that Twitch seeks to be a partner. The prerequisite is 75 viewers. But Twitch takes care to be organic when looking at 75 viewers. So, unfortunately, you cannot meet the 75 audience criteria with a bot. By using bots, you increase the number of viewers of your broadcast and rise to the top. Thus, you will attract organic viewers to your channel and you will complete the criterion by gaining 75 organic viewers over time. In other words, bots allow you to become a Partner indirectly, not directly."

If your viewer bot package expires sooner, you can renew your package and you can continue to use your follower-only add-on package with your new package."
